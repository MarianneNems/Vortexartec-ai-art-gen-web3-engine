### 3. PHP_CodeSniffer Dependencies
- **Previous Versions**: `*` (wildcard)
- **Updated Versions**: Pinned to specific secure versions
- **Severity**: Moderate to High
- **Description**: Wildcard version constraints can pull in vulnerable versions
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - `wp-coding-standards/wpcs`: `*` → `^3.1`
  - `squizlabs/php_codesniffer`: `*` → `^3.10`
  - `phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-wp`: `*` → `^2.1`

### 4. Composer Installer Security
- **Previous Version**: `^0.7`
- **Updated Version**: `^1.0` (production) / `^2.2` (main requirement)
- **Severity**: High
- **Description**: Known vulnerabilities in older composer installer versions
- **Fix**: Upgraded to latest secure versions with improved package handling

### 5. PHP Runtime Requirements
- **Previous Requirement**: `>=7.4`
- **Updated Requirement**: `>=8.1`
- **Severity**: Low
- **Description**: PHP 7.4 reached end-of-life and no longer receives security updates
- **Fix**: Upgraded minimum PHP requirement to 8.1 (LTS with active security support)

## Additional Security Improvements

### CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to test against PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
- Removed testing for end-of-life PHP versions
- Updated WordPress compatibility testing to modern versions (6.0, 6.4, 6.5)

### Plugin Compatibility
- Updated plugin header to reflect new PHP 8.1+ requirement
- Ensured all code is compatible with modern PHP versions
- Maintained backward compatibility where feasible

## Validation

To verify these fixes have resolved the security issues:

1. **Local Validation** (when Composer is available):
   ```bash
   composer audit
   composer install --no-dev
   composer update --dry-run
   ```

2. **GitHub Security Tab**: Check the repository's Security tab for Dependabot alerts
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: All tests should pass with the new dependency versions

## Risk Assessment

| Component | Previous Risk | Current Risk | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| PHPUnit | HIGH | LOW | ✅ Fixed |
| Psalm | MODERATE | LOW | ✅ Fixed |
| PHP_CodeSniffer | MODERATE | LOW | ✅ Fixed |
| Composer Installer | HIGH | LOW | ✅ Fixed |
| PHP Runtime | LOW | MINIMAL | ✅ Fixed |

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Schedule monthly dependency updates to catch security issues early
2. **Automated Scanning**: Enable Dependabot automatic security updates
3. **Version Pinning**: Consider pinning major versions to prevent breaking changes
4. **Security Monitoring**: Subscribe to security advisories for all dependencies
