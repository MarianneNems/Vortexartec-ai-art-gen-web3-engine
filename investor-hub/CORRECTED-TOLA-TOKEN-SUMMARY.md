## üö® **Market Challenges**

### **Current Art Market Problems**
- **Unclear Royalties**: Artists often don't earn from resales ($690M annually lost)
- **Hidden Fees**: Platforms take variable cuts behind the scenes
- **Complex Payments**: Multiple tokens confuse buyers and sellers
- **Fraud Losses**: $4-6 billion in fraud losses yearly (40% of artworks are fake)
- **Lack of Transparency**: 69% of collectors hesitate to buy due to trust issues

These issues slow adoption and weaken trust in the $104 billion art market.

) {
    let mut remaining = price;

    // 1) Vortex Creator Royalty (5%) on all sales
    let creator_fee = price * 5 / 100;
    spl_token::transfer(buyer, vortex_creator_account, creator_fee)?;
    remaining -= creator_fee;

    // 2) Platform Commission (15%) on all sales
    let platform_fee = price * 15 / 100;
    spl_token::transfer(buyer, treasury_account, platform_fee)?;
    remaining -= platform_fee;

    if is_primary {
        // 3a) Primary sale: remainder goes to artist
        spl_token::transfer(buyer, artist, remaining)?;
    } else {
        // 3b) Secondary sale: 15% royalty to original artist
        let artist_royalty = price * 15 / 100;
        spl_token::transfer(buyer, artist, artist_royalty)?;
        remaining -= artist_royalty;

        // 4) Remainder to current seller
        spl_token::transfer(buyer, seller, remaining)?;
    }

    // 5) Mint or transfer NFT to buyer
    mint_or_transfer_nft(buyer, &art_token)?;
}
```

## üèõÔ∏è **Governance & Compliance**

### **Future DAO Governance (Optional)**
We have designed a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that can be activated once the platform matures. This is optional at launch and can be implemented later to avoid complexity for early investors.

**Future DAO Features:**
- **Proposal Rights**: Holders with ‚â•10% TOLA to submit platform improvement proposals
- **Voting Quorum**: ‚â•20% participation; simple majority to decide
- **On-Chain Transparency**: All DAO actions publicly auditable
- **Multi-Sig Admin**: 2-of-3 signers required for contract upgrades

### **Compliance & Controls**
- **KYC/AML**: Required for investor sale and large deposits
- **Token Classification**: TOLA remains a utility/incentive token, non-security
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR & CCPA compliance
