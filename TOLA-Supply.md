# TOLA Token Supply Management

## Current Supply Status

- **Original Supply**: 1,000,000,000 TOLA
- **Burned Amount**: 950,000,000 TOLA
- **Current Total Supply**: 50,000,000 TOLA (fixed)

## Burning History

The TOLA token supply was reduced from 1 billion to 50 million tokens through a strategic burn to increase scarcity and value. This burn was executed to align with the marketplace's growth strategy and to create a more valuable token ecosystem.

## Deflation & Scarcity Strategy

To maintain and increase token value over time, we implement the following deflationary mechanisms:

1. **Optional Fee Burns**: A portion of platform fees are burned.
2. **Unclaimed Rewards**: Expired bonuses are burned weekly.
3. **Event Burns**: Premium events require small burns (50 TOLA).
